 * setup()
 * This is a standard p5.js function that is automatically called once. As you * can guess by its name, you should put any "setup code" in this function
 * (e.g., initializing the canvas, global variable values, placing characters
 * sprites onto the canvas, etc).

/*
 * drawEllipse()
 * This function should draw an ellipse. For the sake of this demo, let's make * it "red" (#ff0000).

/*
 * updateSpread()
 * This function simply sets the spread variable to the value of the slider.
 * For example, if the slider is at 75, the spread will be set to 75 as well.

 /*
  * drawSplatter()
  * Creates ellipses on the canvas around where the mouse is clicked.
  * Details:
  * -The function creates between 10 and 14 ellipses (random).
  * -Each ellipse will be a random color and have no outline.
  * -Each ellipse will have a random radius (5 to 14 pixels).
  * -Each ellipse's x and y values are calculated like this:
  *  x = random value between mouseX - spread and mouseX + spread
  *  y = random value between mouseY - spread and mouseY + spread
